**1. What is censored data?**

Status = 1: Dead

Status = 0: Censored. 

In biological terms, this is an individual that was alive at this point, but went missing from this dataset. 

Some common lab examples that come to mind: 

- A fly that escaped when uncapping the vial
- A fly that was accidentally squished when transferring vials
- A fly that was stuck in the food because you forgot to change the vial
- A worm that crawled into the abyss that is an agar crack

Basically, if an individual was alive up till that point, and died/disappeared due to a reason __other__ than natural causes, we refer to it as a `censored` datapoint.
